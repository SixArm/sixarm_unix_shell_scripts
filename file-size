#/bin/sh
#
# File size in bytes, using the apparent size.
#
# This script has a goal to be cross-platform,
# so it tries a variety of strategies, in order:
#
#   * Try `du --apparent-size`. Standard on Linux.
#   * Try `gdu --apparent-size`. Available in GNU coreutils.
#   * Try `find -printf` Standard on Linux, and likely on others.
#   * Try `gfind -printf`. Available in GNU fileutils.
#   * Try `stat --printf ...`. Not on standard OSX or Solaris.
#   * Try `stat -f%z ...`. Standard on OSX, maybe BSD, and others.
#   * Try `wc -c`. Fast on some systems, but slow on others.
#
# Example:
#
#     file-size example.txt
#     1234
#
# Exit:
#
#   * 0 is success
#   * Anything else is the error code of the command that failed.
#
# ## Environment Variables
#
# This script tries environment variables for command paths:
#
#   * DU: `du` command. Example: `DU=/usr/bin/du`
#   * GDU: `gdu` command. Example: `GDU=/usr/local/bin/gdu`
#   * FIND: `find -printf` command. Example: `FIND=/usr/bin/find`
#   * GFIND: `gfind` command: Example: `GFIND=/usr/local/bin/gfind`
#   * STAT: `stat` command. Example: `STAT=//usr/bin/stat`
#   * WC: `wc` command. Example: `WC=/usr/bin/wc`
#
# Example to provide a custom `du` command path:
#
#     DU=/foo/du file-size example.txt
#
# Example to export a custom `du` command path:
#
#     export DU=/foo/du
#     file-size example.txt
#
# Using an environment variable can boost the speed of this script,
# because it able to use the correct command first, rather than probing.
#
# For example a typical BSD or OSX system has a system `du` that
# doesn't have any option for `--apparent-size` or `--block-size`.
#
# On our systems, we install GNU `du` that does have these options,
# and we call the command `gdu`, and we set the environment variable:
#
#    export DU=/usr/local/bin/gdu
#    file-size example.txt
#
# We typically set our command variables in our /etc/environment file,
# and similar startup files such as our ~/.bashrc file and ~/.zshrc file,
# so our command variables are available for all of our shell scripts.
#
# ## For OSX users
#
# If your system is a typical OSX system, a way to get the GNU commands
# is by using the `brew` package manager and installing GNU packages:
#
#     brew install coreutils findutil
#
# If you want to use the GNU commands without a `g` prefix,
# instead of your default system commands, one way is this:
#
#     brew install --default-names coreutils findutil
#
# Another way is to add the GNU commands to your PATH, such as:
#
#     export PATH=/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH
